    <name>Day 4 - Hill Reps</name>
    <description>warm up - 15 min...4 x 5 min reps with 5mins recovery between each rep.
remain seated whilst climbing. . Idea for today is to not raise heart rates too high but concentrate pressing down hardfrom tops of thighs, keeping a strict style working the core. Keep the burning sensations going. strengthening your ankles, knees and hips. Kind of a GYM session on the bike.  Perhaps do the last one at full speed to flood your body with the lactate.
